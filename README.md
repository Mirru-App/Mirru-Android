# Mirru Android App
Print your own prosthesis and control it with your phone.

Using MediaPipe's hand tracking technology, you can use your camera and your valid hand to change your prothesis's grip in real-time.

The Mirru android app integrates with any servo-powered hand that works with a bluetooth open source microcontroller. You can find the Mirru Arduino code for the Brunel Hand [here](https://github.com/mirru-app/mirru-arduino/)
