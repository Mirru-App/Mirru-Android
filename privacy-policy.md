## Information Collection And Use

**We don't store any data. Period. We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it, as this project has no server database to store any kind of information.**

For utilization of the Mirru app, the software is designed to request the following permissions to enable the software's services:

- Camera permission, without saving or recording
- Bluetooth sharing permission
- Precise location permission (non-continuous)
- Approximate location permission (non-continuous)

It is important to note that Precise and approximate location permissions are necessary to use Bluetooth with Android [source](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth).

No information that may be collected with the enablement of this permission is stored locally on the device, and the developer has no access to that information.

This permission can be revoked when it is not needed (this is privy to only devices running Android 6.0 and upward).
